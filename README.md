## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. How is the contribution to Open Source?
2. How is the characteristics of people who contribute to Open Source?
3. How likely is a person to contribute according to different variables?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions and analysis made.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://carogomezt.medium.com/how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source-8b85b0af2c7c).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
